# Project NutriMithu
NutriMithu is a mobile app to assist with portion control and calorie intake by providing food volume recommendations based on required calorie intake. It comes with a companion smart meal box and scale that alerts you to the food portion and guides with volume markings on the meal box.

I contributed to developing the UI/UX designs and front-end with Flutter, and also designed and prototyped the smart meal box and companion scale.
